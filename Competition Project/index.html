<h1>Tori Keegan</h1>
<h2> My name is Tori </h2>
<p>I don't really know how to code yet, but here's some things I have learnt so far:
<ul>
<li>How to write lists</li>
<li>How to do a split screen on a Mac</li>
<li>How to make things <strong>bold</strong></li>
<p>I've also learnt how to do <em>numbered</em> lists:
<ol><li>Example 1</li>
<li>Example 2</li>
<h2>Tables and images are a bit confusing!</h2>
